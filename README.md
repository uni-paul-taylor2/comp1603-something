This is the answer to the most recent pdf in comp1603 chat

To build and test it, a lot of "given" functions and structs needed to be written out

The actual code for the test is after [line 100](https://github.com/uni-paul-taylor2/comp1603-something/blob/main/20212022.cpp#LL100C1-L100C1) and even then there are a few useless lines only for testing

Enjoy :D
